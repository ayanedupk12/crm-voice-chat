publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to

  assets:

     - assets/Icons/Android/5_Login/drawable-hdpi/img_login.png
     - assets/Icons/Android/2_StoryBoard screen_1/drawable-hdpi/img_story_board_1.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:

     - family: roboto_bold
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/roboto_bold.ttf

     - family: roboto_light
       fonts:
          - asset: fonts/roboto_light.ttf

     - family: roboto_medium
       fonts:
          - asset: fonts/roboto_medium.ttf



     - family: roboto_regular
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/roboto_regular.ttf


     - family: oswald
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/oswald_bold.ttf
